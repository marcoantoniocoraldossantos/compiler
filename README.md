# Compiler Project

This is a simple compiler project for a custom programming language. It includes a lexer and a parser to analyze and process source code written in this language.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Make

### Installing

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/marcoantoniocoraldossantos/compiler

2. Change the working directory to the project's root folder:

   ```bash
   cd compiler-project

3. Build the compiler by running:
   
   ```bash
   make

This will compile the source code and create an executable file named "compiler."

## Running the Compiler

To run the compiler and process a source code file, use the following command:

```bash
./compiler path/to/your-source-file.txt
```

Replace path/to/your-source-file.txt with the actual path to your source code file.

### Example

Here's an example of how to run the compiler with one of the provided test files:

```bash
./compiler test/example1.txt
```
